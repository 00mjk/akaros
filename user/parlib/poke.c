 * Post work and poke synchronization.  This is a wait-free way to make sure
 * some code is run, usually by the calling core, but potentially by any core.
 * Under contention, everyone just posts work, and one core will carry out the
 * work.  Callers post work (the meaning of which is particular to their
 * subsystem), then call this function.  The function is not run concurrently
 * with itself.
 *
 * As far as uthreads, vcores, and preemption go, poking is safe in uthread
 * context and if preemptions occur.  However, a uthread running the poke
 * function that gets preempted could delay the execution of the poke
 * indefinitely.  In general, post-and-poke does not provide any guarantee about
 * *when* the poke finally occurs.  If delays of this sort are a problem, then
 * run poke() from vcore context.

 * currently running (in case someone else is running now).  We won't wait or
 * spin or anything, and it is safe to call this recursively (deeper in the
 * call-graph).
 *
 * It's up to the caller to somehow post its work.  We'll also pass arg to the
 * func, ONLY IF the caller is the one to execute it - so there's no guarantee
 * the func(specific_arg) combo will actually run.  It's more for info
