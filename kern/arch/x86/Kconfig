	bool "Disable fastcall to set FS base"
	default n
	help
		Disable the fast path syscall to set FS base.  If your hardware allows
		setting FS base from userspace, you can say y to disable the fastcall
		for a slight improvement for all syscalls.  If unsure, say n.

config NOMTRRS
	bool "Disable MTRRs"
	default n
	help
		Old debug option from when we were having issues with MTRRs.  If your
		machine won't boot, try turning this on.

config ENABLE_MPTABLES
	bool "Enable MP Tables"
	default n
	help
		Turns on basic MP tables support.  If you want to route IRQs, you'll
		need this, until we get around to parsing ACPI tables.

config KB_CORE0_ONLY
	bool "Keyboard from core0 only"
	default n
	help
		Say 'n' unless you are using a buggy x86 machine that can't handle
		polling the keyboard PIO from cores other than core 0.
