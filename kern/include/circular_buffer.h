 * The circular buffer interface allows to allocate once, and store atomic
 * data blocks into it, with automatic drop of older blocks, when the buffer
 * becomes full.
 * Blocks are written atomically in the sense that when data is dropped from
 * the head of the buffer, full blocks are dropped, so the circular buffer
 * never returns partial blocks.
 * Appending is O(1) WRT the number of blocks, while seeks are O(N).
 * Reading data from the circular buffer interface, does not drop  the read
 * data from the head of the buffer (the head is pushed forward only when the
 * write pointer wraps around and need more space for a new incoming write
 * operation).
 * The buffer can either be initialized with caller memory (if the "mem"
 * parameter of circular_buffer_init() is not NULL), or it can allocate
 * memory by itself in circular_buffer_init().
 * Once the initial (eventual) allocation is done, no more allocations will
 * be performed.
