 * Coalescing Event Queue: encapuslates the essence of epoll/kqueue in shared
 * memory: a dense array of sticky status bits.
 *
 * Like all event mailboxes, CEQs are multi-producer, multi-consumer, with the
 * producer not trusting the consumer.
 *
 * The producer sends ceq_events with a certain ID (the ev_type).  Events of a
 * particular ID are coalesced in one spot, such that N events can occur and the
 * consumer only receives them as one event.  These are the "sticky status
 * bits".  For example, setting flags in an int coalesce (you can set the same
 * flag repeatedly, and it's still set), and an atomic counter coalesces small
 * increments into a larger value.  The nature of the operation (atomic_or,
 * atomic_add) depends on a field in the CEQ.  There is also a data blob field,
 * last-write-wins.  There aren't a lot of guarantees associated with it, but
 * it's still useful for some apps.
 *
 * Internally, a CEQ maintains an array of ceq_event structs for every possible
 * ID, so the maximum ID should be known at ceq creation time.  These structs
 * coalesce the events.  To keep the consumer from needing to scan the array for
 * activity, there is a separate ring buffer that contains the indices of
 * ceq_events with activity.  This is the "dense array."
 *
 * The ring buffer is actually an optimization.  If anything goes wrong, we can
 * tell the consumer to scan the entire array.  Likewise, spurious entries in
 * the ring are safe; the consumer just does an extra check.
 *
 * In general, every time we have an event, we make sure there's a pointer in
 * the ring.  That's the purposed of 'idx_posted' - whether or not we think our
 * index is posted in the ring. */
