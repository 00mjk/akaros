Idiocy: seem to need +x on local.bash *AND* it needs to be in your path.

After you have downloaded the GO repo, you need to modify
$GOROOT/src/local.bash to set up your $ROSROOT and $GOBIN directories
as well as select whether you are building GO for the 386 architecture
or amd64. After you have set this up, simply run ./akaros.bash from
the $GOROOT/src/ directory to build and install GO for Akaros.

Assuming you have $GOBIN in your PATH, you should now be able to run
the command go-akaros-$ARCH, where $ARCH is one of either 386 or
amd64, depending on which architecture you chose to build for.

In order to build some example programs as well as the full GO test
suite for Akaros, go to $GOROOT/examples and run the ./examples.bash
script to see a list of build and install options.  Any example
programs or tests that are built using this script are installed into
a $GOROOT/examples/kfs directory, which you can direct Akaros to
include in its KFS path (see the instructions in the GETTING_STARTED
document in the Akaros source tree to see how to do this).  When
installing tests from the GO test suite, a convenience script is
installed into kfs/bin/gotests.sh so that you can simply launch this
script to run any installed tests back to back.


How Ron built it.

My local.bash
export ROSROOT="$HOME/akaros"
export GOBIN="$HOME/go-install"
export GOOS=akaros
export GOARCH=amd64
export TARGETCC=x86_64-ros-gcc
export TARGETCXX=x86_64-ros-g++

And in my shell:
export GOPATH=/home/rminnich/install/go-install/
export GOROOT=/home/rminnich/go

local.bash has to be +x
chmod +x local.bash

Stupidly, ubuntu bash want files you source in $PATH!
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/core_perl:/usr/local/plan9/bin:/usr/local/src/depot_tools/
:/home/rminnich/install/go-install/

PATH=$PATH:~/ros-gcc-glibc/install-x86_64-ros-gcc/bin/:`pwd`
sh akaros.bash 

Build tests
cd ../go-akaros/examples/
GOROOT=~/go-akaros/
./examples.bash -t all

How Ron runs it from the 9p mount point. 
Start go9p on another terminal/host:
./go9p -addr=:1025 -root=/usr/local/crouton/drinkcat-chroagh-6b888af/chroots/arch/home/rminnich/

Note the root can be anything. I made it my ~ so I have less typing to do.
The script, when it runs, probably wants things in /; maybe I was missing some environment
variable, so:
mkdir /gotests
cp -r /mnt/go-akaros/examples/kfs/gotests / 

Now you can run the tests.
ash /mnt/go-akaros/examples/kfs/bin/gotests.sh 

These are running in kfs.
