 * fork() callbacks.
 *
 * These are called after a process forks by the child.
 *
 * To register a cb, do your own allocation of a fork_cb, fill in func, then
 * call register_fork_cb.  You cannot remove your CB.  Concurrent calls to
 * fork() may or may not run your callback.
 *
 * Due to the plethora of user-level implementations of things normally in the
 * kernel, such as select(), those systems may need to deal with fork() in a
 * special way.  Imagine a process that forks, but does not exec.  The state of
 * those systems may no longer be valid, since they may rely on kernel state
 * that is no longer present.
 *
 * Specifically, select is built in taps, and select is supposed to be
 * stateless, but ours relies on kernel state (taps).  Taps are not inherited
 * (via fork or dup).  If you forked, select() would think it had taps set up,
 * when in fact it didn't. */
