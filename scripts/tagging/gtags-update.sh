# Builds/updates a gtags database for all directories/paths listed in GTAGS_INC_FILE
# (.gtagsinclude).  If you are in a gtags-managed directory (subdir), it will
# update from the rootdir.  If not, it will attempt to build a new gtags
# database, if you have the whitelist file.
#
# This will also do the incremental update, so run this when you have new files
# in the system.  Don't run global -u, since it takes forever, and is probably
# doing something I don't like.
