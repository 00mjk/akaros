scripts/tagging holds a few utilities for code tagging.

MAKETAGS is Ron's script for ctags.

The other stuff is for brho's Gnu Global setup.  If you want to use it, add the
bashrc chunk to your bashrc, and put the scripts in your path.  I put them in
~/scripts.

The global scripts are made to work similar to git grep, allowing you to run
global on a subdirectory.  For instance, you can run gl (the bash alias for
global) on kern/ to limit your search to only kernel files.

I commonly run something like:
$ gl functi(TAB TAB) (uses the tab complete)
$ gl function

To see info about 'function'.  Add -x for "explicit" info, and -r for
"references" (who calls function).  Check out
http://www.gnu.org/software/global/ for more info.

Whenever you change files, you need to update the GTAGS database, otherwise the
system will be out of date.  It's not a huge deal, but you'll be off by a
couple lines.  This hurts more when integrated with your editor.

To update, run 'gtu' (my alias for scripts/tagging/gtags-update.sh)

Global integrates nicely with vi (and other editors).  For instance, in my
vimrc, I have:

noremap <c-k> :GtagsCursor<CR>

Which binds the global command to Ctrl-K.

I also use:

noremap <c-h> :nohlsearch<CR> :ccl<CR>

to clear my highlighted search and to close the little search window opened by
global.
